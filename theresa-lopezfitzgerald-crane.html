She was raised mainly by her mother Pilar and her brother Luis. Her family had such hopes and dreams for her...that did not include Ethan Winthrop. Theresa began her obsession with Ethan Crane (Winthrop) when she was a teenager. She had the fantasy that he would come to Harmony and fall in love with her just like a fairytale. Theresa would even refuse attempts from other guys wanting to date her, saving herself for her true love, Ethan - even though the two of them had never met. The hopeful teen thought that her dreams were going to come true when she found out that he was returning to Harmony the summer of her senior year in high school. The one thing that she didn't plan on was him bringing his long time girlfriend Gwen with him. This was the summer that crazy things began to take place in all of their lives.</p><p>Theresa got a job as a social secretary with Ivy and thought that it was the perfect way to get close to Ethan so that she could convince him that they were meant to be together. Theresa went from a silly teenage girl to a borderline stalker. It got to the point that Ethan was going to have her arrested until her best friend Whitney pleaded her case and convinced him that Theresa meant no harm. At one point Theresa even had a guy named Chuck pose as her boyfriend to keep a suspicious Gwen at ease. She slowly started to panic when she realized that Ethan planned on marrying Gwen! The pain became unbearable for Theresa, but luckily she made up a story that Chuck had dumped her to cover up the real reason behind her devastation. Gwen asked Theresa to help Ethan plan their wedding while she finished taking care of some outstanding business issues. Of course Theresa took this as a sign and tried to use the time to get as close to Ethan as possible. When Theresa finally got the nerve and confessed her love to Ethan, he suggested that she was just on the rebound and moved forward with his plans for the wedding. Theresa, devastated yet again, got on Miguel's motorcycle and sped away. She ended up crashing the bike and landed in the hospital.</p><p>She woke up in the hospital to what she believed was her dream come true - Ethan kissing her and telling her that he loves her. She is hurt again when he told her that it was a complicated situation, and that he still loved Gwen. Meanwhile, Rebecca (Gwen's mother) started to realize what Theresa was up to and attacked her at every turn. Gwen defended Theresa but still couldn't help but wonder if her mother had some valid points. Theresa finally had reached her boiling point on the eve of the big wedding when Rebecca told her that Ethan was just using her. She ran home and started packing to leave town. She ran across some letters that Ivy had written detailing that Ethan was not Julian's son - he was Ivy's son with Sam Bennett! Theresa impulsively scanned the letters to her computer and planned to blackmail Ivy with them.</p><p>Ethan arrived at the airport to stop the plane and tell Theresa that he loved her. Gwen suggested that Ethan date both of them (with the expectation that he would come to his senses). Things started to finally fall into place for Theresa when Ethan proposed to her on Christmas Eve. Pilar pleaded with her daughter to erase the letters from her computer, but Theresa insisted that she may need them one day. Theresa finally did as her mother suggested and erased the letters. To her surprise on the day of their engagement party, the tabloids ran a cover story revealing Ethan's true paternity. The couple still moved forward with the wedding plans and scheduled a double wedding with Luis and Sheridan. On their happy day, the day of Theresa's dreams, the tabloids revealed the email address of the person who supplied them with the story of Ethan's paternity - Theresa's email address! Theresa panicked and ran away to Whitney's. Her bright idea to fix this situation was to have Julian adopt Ethan and keep him as a Crane. So, off to Bermuda she went.</p><p>Julian went along with her rambling and over-served her with glasses of champagne. One thing led to another and the two of them woke up the next morning - married! Theresa swore that she would never tell Ethan what had happened. Shortly after the Bermuda trip, Theresa realized that she was expecting her first child. She struggled with her decision to keep the baby and when the tabloids reported that she visited an abortion clinic, Theresa had the impossible task of telling Ethan that the baby was Julian's. Ethan was furious and washed his hands of Theresa. Julian Crane was shot and killed that same night. For the next while, Theresa was at battle with Rebecca and Ivy for the Crane fortune and mansion. Thanks to Alistair paying off the judge, Theresa emerged as the winner. Theresa panicked when she saw a video of Ethan killing Julian, and confessed to the murder. Her plan of them never throwing a Crane in jail didn't quite work and she was sentenced to death.</p><p>Ethan did help Theresa escape, but when they made it to the cabin, she was in labor. Theresa went into a state of rage when Gwen showed up and she had to watch them have an emotional reunion. She actually went after them with a pair of scissors and ended up stabbing Gwen in the back. When they managed to get her to the sofa, she was fully dilated and gave birth to her baby boy. All of the resentment towards Julian and the baby for interfering with her plans to land Ethan were quickly gone. Days after the baby was born, Theresa was executed for the murder of Julian. Turns out that she was only pretending to be dead so that Julian would feel safe to come out of hiding. Theresa refused Julian of any rights to the child. Although Ethan was still with Gwen, Theresa remained hopeful.</p><p>Theresa insisted that Alistair make her VP of Crane Industries and she used that power to ensure that Ethan would not get hired anywhere-else. She was able to keep Ethan in town, but he still married Gwen. She became fast friends with Fox and got some shocking news from Julian - that they were not really married! To top it off, Julian also was going to take her to court for full custody of their child. Ethan and Gwen then had news of their own - that they were expecting a baby. Theresa still carefully pursued Ethan but didn't want to harm their baby. Gwen and Theresa got into a serious argument one night and Theresa insisted that she was going to be with Ethan. Gwen ended up falling and hitting her head when she lunged at Theresa. She was rushed to the hospital and ended up losing the baby. Everyone had it in for Theresa over what happened in Los Angeles with Gwen and the baby. A custody battle again took place over the well-being of little Ethan. Theresa was up against all odds. Theresa said some horrible things and went to apologize to Gwen, but she didn't want to hear and demanded that Theresa leave. Theresa kept on pushing and yet another altercation took place. During the argument she and Gwen fought, and Gwen went flying out of the window! Ethan and Gwen were later informed that due to what happened in Los Angeles, she would not be able to have a child. The couple decided to go the surrogate route.</p><p>Theresa felt that her only way to get little Ethan back was to have herself implanted with Gwen's eggs, so she kidnapped the surrogate and impersonated her at the doctor's office. The plan worked and she ended up drugging Ethan, pretending to be Gwen and raping him becoming pregnant! Theresa could now go on with her plan to blackmail them into giving her little Ethan back! The real shock was when she was informed that she was pregnant with twins, and that one of the babies could actually be Gwen's. She pretended the entire time that she was going to give them the baby as soon as it was born. When the doctor informed her that she could not carry both babies to term she wanted desperately to have a DNA test to ensure that her baby with Ethan survived. Ethan convinced her to let the doctors make the choice depending on which ever one was the healthiest. Theresa finally delivered the baby and informed Gwen and Ethan that she never had any intentions of giving them the child. Gwen was astounded when Theresa told her about what she did to have sex with Ethan (the drugging part). A DNA test was conducted and Gwen was crushed yet again when it was revealed that Theresa was indeed the biological mother. Gwen suffered a major mental breakdown and kidnapped the baby. Theresa promised Ethan that she would not press charges against her if she would just bring the baby back.</p><p>Gwen finally came back to her senses and returned to Harmony, but Theresa did not keep her promise yet again. She later made the bold move to be Alistair Crane's wife in the hopes that his money and power could get her what she wanted. Instead, it only brought torture and continual rape. She tried to poison him one night but accidentally poisoned Ethan instead. In a fit, expecting that Gwen would take him off life-support, she stole his body and took him to the Crane cabin where he, eventually, regained consciousness.</p><p>Theresa would do whatever it took to get her son back and to break up Gwen and Ethan's marriage. She arranged for Gwen to get a job that would keep her away from home quite a bit so that she could get close to Ethan again. Theresa tracked down the tabloid editor in Rome and offered him ten million dollars to tell the truth about who sent the news about Ethan's paternity to him. Of course he was happy to help for that amount of money, but unfortunately Ethan didn't believe him since Theresa was the one who was behind the confession. Ethan has had enough of Theresa's manipulation over the years.</p><p>Returning to Harmony, she tried to move on and, with Alistair dead, she began a relationship with Jared Casey. This made Ethan jealous and he began to pursue her. They began an affair, although she still married Jared. As Ethan and Gwen's marriage came apart, he continued to go after the Theresa. Tempted to finally be with Ethan, she wanted to tell him the truth about their child but was then being blackmailed to keep it from him. As she sent her spies out to find the blackmailer, both the men in her life went in pursuit as well. Jared was shot in the process and she was forced by the blackmailer to marry him. Once they were married, she continued her affair with Ethan, despite the blackmailer's threats to destroy her if she did. All of this kept her very busy and she barely had time to help her brothers when they were thrown in prison.</p><p>Eventually, Jared decided to leave the unbearable situation. The blackmailer was later caught and this left Theresa free to be with Ethan. Things were complicated when Gwen return but she couldn't break them up. After they got married, however, Alistair reappeared and tried to kill them. Although he failed to kill Theresa, he accidentally put Ethan in a coma. When Ethan revived, she had an even bigger problem: Gwen showed up at his bedside with their son. This shocked everyone and created a serious dint in the relationship again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmqZmjqLawutJomqGZopawtbHRrGatoJWnsrStjKWmqZ2qm7a1xsaeqZqklGKws63NnmY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftheresa-lopezfitzgerald-crane.html&text=Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald%20Crane&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftheresa-lopezfitzgerald-crane.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftheresa-lopezfitzgerald-crane.html&title=Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald%20Crane" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftheresa-lopezfitzgerald-crane.html&title=Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald%20Crane" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftheresa-lopezfitzgerald-crane.html&title=Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald%20Crane" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftheresa-lopezfitzgerald-crane.html&description=Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald%20Crane" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./waylon-jennings-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Waylon Jennings - Bio, Age, net worth, height, Wiki, Facts and Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-jessica-parker-twin-daughters-rare-appearance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Jessica Parker's Twins Make Rare Red Carpet Appearance">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
