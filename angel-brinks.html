Her eponymous line of fashion is focused on leggings, bodysuits, dresses, lingerie, rompers, denim, and jackets.</p><p>Angel Brinks was born on <i>19 October 1982</i> in Los Angeles, Califonia, USA, under the zodiac sign of Libra. From childhood, she became interested in the globe of fashion and glamour. In addition, at the age of three, she started taking ballet classes.&nbsp;</p><p>The star holds American nationality and belongs to a mixed Armenian and Italian ethnic background. There is no comprehensive data on the academic background of Brinks. But she said she attended Night College in an interview with different sources and would work during the day.</p><p>Following her strong enthusiasm for fashion design, Angel went to performing arts but introduced her clothing line Angel Brink fashion in 2010 to bring her passion to reality.</p><p>Through her line of fashion, Angel can reach out to females who always want to look elegant, edgy, sexy, and yet confident. The most interesting fact is, she has featured the New York Fashion Week 2012 as well as the Fashion Show of Facet Studio 2013 and 2014. Her clothing line is still doing really good so far.</p><h2>Personal Life: Husband&nbsp;</h2><p>It's no new that lovely Angel Blinks was once married to a beautiful-looking person she met when Blinks was an escort in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/5/24/tyr-1621860956358.JPG><p>Sadly there are no further details about her husband. The only information we could grab about him was that he committed suicide when Angel was nine months pregnant. As for now, Angel is also living a very happy life with her child, <strong>Azari</strong>.</p><p>A few years later, <a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Angel was in a relationship with Tyreke Evans</strong></i></a>, an NBA basketball player.
