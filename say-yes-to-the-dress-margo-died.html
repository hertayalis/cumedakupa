After the trip, Margo started feeling unwell, so she booked a doctor’s appointment.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I will never forget what I thought when the doctor told me the news,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. “The first thing that ran through my mind was, ‘I don’t want to die.’ I had just been told that I had cervical cancer. Cancer? But I thought that it was nothing serious? How is this possible? The gynecologist couldn’t tell us much about my cancer; all she could tell me is that I had always done everything right. But if I did everything right, then why am I sitting here? … I had just been told that I had cancer, but now I wished more than anything that I could go back to not knowing, go back to what I considered ‘normal.’”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She got married in August 2012.</h2><p>Margo and Derek had a <a href=#>destination wedding</a>, tying the knot in Punta Cana on Aug. 8, 2012. “Every time I feel like I can’t get through another day, I picture myself marrying Derek on the beach,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged</a>. “I know that this is what we deserve, and what is going to make us both happy.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And TLC cameras were rolling when Margo — dressed in her $2,500 Alita Graham gown — said her “I do’s” with Derek. “I’m feeling great. I got to marry the love of my life today. She looks gorgeous,” the groom said on the show.</p><p>Added Margo, “Our wedding symbolizes no matter what anyone throws at us, we will still stand by each other’s side.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Margo passed away the following month.</h2><p>Margo’s mother, Hilliary, announced Margo’s death on her daughter’s blog, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, “My beautiful, kind, generous, artistic, thoughtful, innocent, newlywed daughter lost her all-too-brief battle with cancer on Sept. 21, 2012. … Margo spent her last hours battling this horrific disease with every ounce of her being, just as she did every day since receiving her diagnosis in December of 2011.”</p><p>Hilliary also spoke to her daughter’s resilience. “Margo never wanted to hear the odds she was up against and faced every appointment, surgery, treatment, and scan with a smile on her face, making friends along the way. … I continue to miss my Margo deeply and struggle daily to find my way in a world void of her scrunched-nose smile. … We were not given a choice about Margo’s illness or the outcome, but we do have a choice as to what we will do with our pain. … We can let it tear us apart, or we can let it bring out greatness. I know what Margo is cheering for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK66edieqmasn2LBqbGMnameq6NiuqK%2BxqhknaGVmQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html&text=%27Say%20Yes%20to%20the%20Dress%20Margo%20Died%20After%20Battling%20Cervical%20Cancer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html&title=%27Say%20Yes%20to%20the%20Dress%20Margo%20Died%20After%20Battling%20Cervical%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html&title=%27Say%20Yes%20to%20the%20Dress%20Margo%20Died%20After%20Battling%20Cervical%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html&title=%27Say%20Yes%20to%20the%20Dress%20Margo%20Died%20After%20Battling%20Cervical%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsay-yes-to-the-dress-margo-died.html&description=%27Say%20Yes%20to%20the%20Dress%20Margo%20Died%20After%20Battling%20Cervical%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danny-bonaduce-net-worth-2024-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Bonaduce Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-are-the-richest-k-pop-groups-in-south-korea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What are the richest K-Pop groups in South Korea?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
