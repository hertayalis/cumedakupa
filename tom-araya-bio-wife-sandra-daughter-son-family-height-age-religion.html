Until the 2010s, Araya was known for his aggressive headbutts during performances.&nbsp;However, a throat injury which required surgery saw him become more stable and subtle in his performance.</span></p><p><span>With Slayer, he won two Grammy Awards for the songs ‘Eyes of the Insane’ and ‘Final Six’, both from their 2006 album Christ Illusion, widely considered one of their most successful albums ever. modern era.&nbsp;Slayer sold over 5 million albums between the early 90s and 2013 in the United States alone.&nbsp;After 37 years of performing together, Slayer embarked on their farewell tour in 2018.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tom Araya Bio (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tom Araya was born Tomás Enrique Araya Díaz on June 6, 1961 in Viña del Mar, Chile.&nbsp;When he was 5 years old, his family moved to the United States, where they lived in Maywood, a small town in southeast Los Angeles County, California.&nbsp;The neighborhood was known for its recurring gang-related violence.</span></p><p><span>Influenced by his older brother named Cisco who Araya at age 8, fell in love with music and started playing bass guitar.&nbsp;With his brother, he would play Beatles and Rolling Stones songs.</span></p><p><span>In his early twenties, Araya at the suggestion of his sister enrolled in a program that would see him become a certified respiratory therapist.&nbsp;Soon he found a job and quickly became a founding member of the heavy metal band Slayer after being approached by Kerry King.&nbsp;The band began recording with the help of money earned by Araya as a respiratory disease specialist.&nbsp;In 1983, their debut album, Show No Mercy, was released.</span></p><p><span>Throughout this time, Tom Araya retained his position, but time conflicts between his job and tour dates would later force him to quit his job in 1984.</span></p><p><span>In addition to his older brother, Cisco, who played guitar, Araya has another brother, Juan “Johnny” Araya, who like him plays bass and is in the melodic death metal band Thine Eyes Bleed.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His family – wife (Sandra), daughter and son</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tom Araya is a family man and a loyal man.&nbsp;Since 1995, he has been married to his wife Sandra Araya.&nbsp;They each have a tattoo of each other’s name on their arms.&nbsp;Perhaps what drew them to each other is their shared fascination with horror movies.&nbsp;At the top of their list of favorites is&nbsp;</span><span>The Amityville Horror</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</span></p><p><span>Araya and his wife share daughter of two ArielAsa Araya, born May 11, 1996, and son, Tomas Enrique Araya Jr., born June 14, 1999. Both of his children are homeschooled.&nbsp;The family resides in Buffalo, Texas.&nbsp;There, Araya and his wife operate a ranch that has at least 60 head of cattle.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Tom Araya’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Religion</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tom Araya helped make some of the most “demonic” songs the world has ever heard, making religion a controversial topic.&nbsp;Slayer was one of the bands to use a lot of satanic imagery in the 1980s. Tom Araya himself was open to his fascination with serial killers, which inspired many of his band’s songs.&nbsp;He has openly revealed that he has the most twisted mind of the bunch when it comes to finding ways to kill people and, more generally, death.&nbsp;Despite Slayer’s heavy use of satanic imagery, Tom Araya has claimed that he is Catholic, believing in Christ and an all-loving God.</span></p><p><span>He also explained that his group image could never interfere with his belief system which he says is rock solid.&nbsp;However, many considered his explanations hypocritical.&nbsp;Tom pointed out that the popular belief that Slayer members are Satan worshipers is just a misconception.&nbsp;He clarified in 2016 that the main reason Slayer used satanic imagery was to scare people.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height – How tall is it?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tom Araya towers above an average height man, standing 5ft 10in which is the equivalent of 1.78m.&nbsp;Her hair is black and her eyes are dark brown.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGisn6J6or7Asphmmpmkeri1xZ5krJmemb%2BiecOarKCgpJq%2Fbr%2FOp2SfmZ2eubp5x56goKCkYq6osYyrnKWhl568r3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-araya-bio-wife-sandra-daughter-son-family-height-age-religion.html&text=Tom%20Araya%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%20%28Sandra%29%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Religion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-araya-bio-wife-sandra-daughter-son-family-height-age-religion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-araya-bio-wife-sandra-daughter-son-family-height-age-religion.html&title=Tom%20Araya%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%20%28Sandra%29%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Religion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-araya-bio-wife-sandra-daughter-son-family-height-age-religion.html&title=Tom%20Araya%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%20%28Sandra%29%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Religion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-araya-bio-wife-sandra-daughter-son-family-height-age-religion.html&title=Tom%20Araya%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%20%28Sandra%29%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Religion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-araya-bio-wife-sandra-daughter-son-family-height-age-religion.html&description=Tom%20Araya%20%20Biography%2c%20Wife%20%28Sandra%29%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Son%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Age%2c%20Religion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-latoya-forever-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is LaToya Forever Dating Now? -Past Relationships, Current Relationship Status, Rumours, and Fac">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./199406-tmz-floyd-mayweathers-close-relative-rog-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TMZ: Roger Mayweather, Former World Champion Boxer &amp;amp; Trainer for His Nephew Floyd Mayweather Jr, Die">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
