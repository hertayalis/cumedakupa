Keep scrolling for a quick recap on everything Zach Dempsey, including the actor who plays him and what his plans are after the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DAVID MOIR/NETFLIX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Zach Dempsey on '13 Reasons Why'?</h2><p>Zach (Ross Butler) is Hannah (Katherine Langford)’s seventh "reason." On the tapes in Season 1, audiences learned that Zach had originally truly liked Hannah and had tried to ask her out a few times.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when she rejected him (even though technically, he never expressly asked her out), Zach was insulted and decided to get revenge by stealing the notes of positivity that Hannah and her classmates would leave for each other.</p><p>During Season 3 of the show, Zach was dealing with the loss of his athletic career after a fight on the football field left him in crutches. However, audiences later learned that Zach wasn’t letting his friends in on everything about the fight.</p><p>It turned out that it was Bryce (Justin Prentice), the kid who raped Hannah and Zach’s friend-turned-enemy, who broke Zach’s knee during the fight. In retaliation, Zach followed Bryce to the docks where he proceeded to beat Bryce to a bloody mess.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DAVID MOIR/NETFLIX</span></figure><p>When noble-hearted Zach later learns of Bryce’s death, he confesses to what he thinks is murder, only to be informed that Bryce’s cause of death was drowning, and not a result of the injuries he sustained during their fight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what’s going on with Zach in Season 4?</h2><p>Like many other characters on the show, Zach’s had to deal with some pretty intense trauma and guilt given that his crush killed herself and he possibly aided in the death of his ex-best friend.</p><p>Showrunner Brian Yorkey has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that “in Season 4, we take Zach places that I had not expected until we really got into the room and delved into his story. We took Zach some really interesting places.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: DAVID MOIR/NETFLIX</span></figure><p>Brian continued to sing praises for actor Ross Butler. “I've always loved that character and I love Ross Butler," he says, "so that was a lot of fun and a challenge and also a wonderful collaboration and I think it's going to be cool to watch.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where else can you watch Ross Butler?</h2><p>Ross Butler landed his breakout role with Disney’s K.C. Undercover. You may also recognize him from his short stint as Reggie Mantle on Riverdale before he left the show for 13 Reasons Why and was replaced by Charles Melton.&nbsp;</p><p>Ross has also starred in movies like 2019’s Shazam! and was in Netflix’s To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You. This year, you can catch Ross starring across Mad Men’s Kiernan Shipka in the new Quibi series, Swimming with Sharks.</p><p>Stream Season 4 of 13 Reasons Why on Netflix Friday, June 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSzmZOdenJ%2FjKucmqufo8Buw8ey</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-zach-13-reasons-why.html&text=What%27s%20Going%20on%20With%20Zach%20on%20%2713%20Reasons%20Why%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-zach-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-zach-13-reasons-why.html&title=What%27s%20Going%20on%20With%20Zach%20on%20%2713%20Reasons%20Why%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-zach-13-reasons-why.html&title=What%27s%20Going%20on%20With%20Zach%20on%20%2713%20Reasons%20Why%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-zach-13-reasons-why.html&title=What%27s%20Going%20on%20With%20Zach%20on%20%2713%20Reasons%20Why%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-zach-13-reasons-why.html&description=What%27s%20Going%20on%20With%20Zach%20on%20%2713%20Reasons%20Why%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./betty-gillette.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Betty Gillette">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-wattpad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Wattpad?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
