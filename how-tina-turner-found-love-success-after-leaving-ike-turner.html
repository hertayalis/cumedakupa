She was still attending high school In Illinois when she met future husband<strong>&nbsp;Ike Turner</strong> (who passed away in 2007) at a New York City night club, and started singing for his band The Kings of Rhythm, which not long after became <strong>the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.</strong></p><p id=eVKonoZdfrH data-wc=72>The husband-wife duo soon found fame in the 1960s – their first R&B hit was "A Fool in Love" in 1960 – though behind the scenes, the story wasn't so sparkling. <strong>"My relationship with Ike was doomed the day he figured out I was going to be his moneymaker,”</strong> she wrote her 2018 memoir, My Love Story, where she also recalled Ike forcing her to change her last name against her will.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Music Stars Gone Too Soon</figure><p id=eehtDYeUTx3 data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Tina Turner death: celebrities react, pay tribute to the beloved music legend</a></p><p id=egdJV1BEuVS data-wc=96>The two married in 1962 in Tijuana, Mexico.

The couples' first and only biological son, <strong>Ronnie Turner,</strong> was born in 1960, and he passed away in December of 2022 from complications of colon cancer. They also shared <strong>Ike Turner Jr</strong>, Ike Sr.'s son with <strong>Lorraine Taylor</strong> born in 1958, plus his brother <strong>Michael Turner</strong>, born in 1959.</p><p id=ekDLoBlxgno data-wc=50>As the musical pair's fame and success began to grow, so did Ike's abuse towards Tina, which she famously recounted in both of her memoirs. She said of her ex-husband: "First, he was verbally abusive. Then, he picked up a wooden shoe stretcher," adding: <strong>"Ike knew what he was doing."</strong></p><p id=eGDo_KJppRr data-wc=15><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Celebrities pay tribute to Thor, Star Wars actor Ray Stevenson following death aged 58</a></strong></p><p id=ejBKbmoPmlX data-wc=34><strong>"I was living a life of death,"</strong> she also said in a 2021 HBO documentary about her life, Tina, about the abuse she endured throughout 16 years of marriage amid Ike's growing drug addiction.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6b101cd1770-gettyimages-478994064.jpg><p id=eyQmcaZn2sN data-wc=31>In her first memoir, I, Tina: My Life Story, written in 1986 with <strong>Kurt Loder</strong>, she told her co-author: "It wasn't a good life.

They met at an airport in Germany in 1985, after her manager at the time asked him to pick her up. It was an outstandingly different love than that of what she had with Ike, if you can call it love, and he went so far as to donate a kidney to her when she struggled with kidney disease. She was "overwhelmed by the enormity of his offer," she wrote in her memoir.</p><p id=ekoMO1_n24Y data-wc=27>Tina is survived by Erwin, as well as Ike's two sons with Lorraine, who she adopted early into their marriage.
