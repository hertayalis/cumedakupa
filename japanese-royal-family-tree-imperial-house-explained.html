Aiko's birth, and Naruhito and Masako not producing a male heir, <strong>prompted plenty of debate about whether the laws around succession should change to absolute primogeniture as opposed to agnatic, which would allow Aiko to succeed to the throne</strong>. However, following the birth of Crown Prince Fumihito's son, these discussions were dropped.</p><p id=eJGdYqZYGBKg data-wc=66>Aiko's childhood title is Princess Toshi, and her personal naming broke from tradition, with Naruhito and Masako choosing her name instead of her grandfather, Akihito. Her education was briefly interrupted as the young royal was bullied by boys in her class and when she returned to school, she was accompanied by her mother. She later majored in Japanese language and literature, graduating on 20 March 2024.</p><h2>Mako Komura</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7bd7fd02cc5-princess-mako-tennis.jpg><p id=e3cUjmvJGzCv data-wc=42>Born on 23 October 1991, <a class=hm-link href=#>Mako Komura</a> is the eldest child of Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko.
