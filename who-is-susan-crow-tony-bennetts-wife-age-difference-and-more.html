She is in her mid-fifties and was Bennett’s full-time caregiver before he passed away. She was born in San Francisco on September 9, 1966.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>She attended Fordham University and Columbia University, according to reports, and worked as an administrative assistant at Merrill Lynch before she moved into teaching.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>The couple has no children together, and she’s about forty years younger than her late husband. Bennett is also survived by four children from his two previous wives.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>She started a non-profit, Exploring the Arts (ETA), with her husband in 1999, as well as launching a management company named Creative Artists Management.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Bennett described meeting Crow in his 2016 book Just Getting Started, when her mother wanted a photo with the singer backstage.</p><p>“As fate would have it, [Susan’s mother] was pregnant at the time with… Susan! It’s a photo we all laugh about, knowing the incredible turn of events that followed.”</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>The implications of that aside, the couple reportedly met when Crow was in her 20s and Bennett was in his 60s. He elaborated on that in the book as well.</p><p>“When she was nineteen she had tickets to see me perform at the Masonic Temple in San Francisco and she put in a request to say hello backstage after the show, probably not expecting a response. The request was sent to me, and it tickled me that someone of her age was so devoted to my music. I not only agreed to say hello to her backstage, but asked her to be my date for the evening, and that’s how it really all began … foreshadowed by a backstage photo taken in 1966!”</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Crow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke with</a> journalist Anderson Cooper for an interview on 60 Minutes and revealed that Tony was unaware that he had Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>“He recognizes me, thank goodness, his children, you know, we are blessed in a lot of ways. He’s very sweet. He doesn’t know he has it (Alzheimer’s disease),” she said. “I know that his hippocampus, which is the Grand Central Station of memories — and the conduit through which we retrieve memories as well as lay down memories is not working very well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmq6Worq95wqumsGWkpLu6ecGepaedpKnAbsPIn5xmmZeaeqW1xZ%2Bcq52emLJurc2dZKanopp8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-susan-crow-tony-bennetts-wife-age-difference-and-more.html&text=Who%20is%20Susan%20Crow%3f%20Tony%20Bennetts%20wife%2c%20age%20difference%2c%20and%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-susan-crow-tony-bennetts-wife-age-difference-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-susan-crow-tony-bennetts-wife-age-difference-and-more.html&title=Who%20is%20Susan%20Crow%3f%20Tony%20Bennetts%20wife%2c%20age%20difference%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-susan-crow-tony-bennetts-wife-age-difference-and-more.html&title=Who%20is%20Susan%20Crow%3f%20Tony%20Bennetts%20wife%2c%20age%20difference%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-susan-crow-tony-bennetts-wife-age-difference-and-more.html&title=Who%20is%20Susan%20Crow%3f%20Tony%20Bennetts%20wife%2c%20age%20difference%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-susan-crow-tony-bennetts-wife-age-difference-and-more.html&description=Who%20is%20Susan%20Crow%3f%20Tony%20Bennetts%20wife%2c%20age%20difference%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./all-about-solage-ortiz-net-worth-relationship-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Solage Ortiz | Net Worth, Relationship, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-john-cowsill-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is John Cowsill Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
