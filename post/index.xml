木下百花さんは2017年に卒業するまでNMBに所属していたのです。
アイドル時代から将来はニートになりたい、会社の偉い人になって女子社員にケツタッチしたいなどインパクトある発言を繰り返してきました、（ほとんどがバラエディ番組での発言で冗談だと思いますが）
ソロ歌手として活動してる現在、木下百花さんの超個性的なファッションや私生活が再び注目されています。
アイドル時代と現在で明らかに違うのは見た目の出立ちですね。
首の目立つところに大きなタトゥーを入れるなど、かなり大胆なイメチェンを行っています。この刺青を巡っては新旧のファンで賛否分かれてるみたいです。
また、あまりにもボーイッシュなファッションや言動から、木下百花さんがバイなのではないか？という疑惑が向けられています。すでに彼女がいるのか・・・性同一性障害なのではないかなどなど噂は後を断ちません。
木下百花のやばいタトゥー。首の下の蜘蛛の刺青（画像） 木下百花さんがメディアに登場する度にツイッターなど話題になるのが、彼女のタトゥーです。
彼女は女性であるにも関わらず、海外の男性ミュージシャンのような厳ついタトゥーを入れているのです。
しかも、入れてる体の場所が首の下というのが驚きです・・・・。
正直、かっこいいし似合っているのですが、大衆向きではありませんし、女性として男性のファンを獲得するには都合の悪いファッションだと思います。
彼女がこの刺青を入れた姿で初めてテレビに出演したのは2020年9月24日に放送された「アウトデラックス」でした。
番組の放送が終わった後にすぐにYahoo!ニュースに取り上げられ、トレンド入りを果たしました。
１７年９月にＮＭＢ４８を卒業し、現在はシンガーソングライターの木下百花（２３）が２４日、フジテレビ系で放送された「アウト×デラックス」に出演。首にクモのタトゥーを入れたことについて語った。
現在、黒髪でショートヘアの木下。首の前（喉）部分には、握りこぶし大のスパイダーのタトゥーが彫られている。 人生初のタトゥーだったというが、事務所には内緒で入れたもの。そのことを質問されると「ナイショとかじゃない。普通にやっただけ」と否定した。
首の前の目立つ場所に入れた理由については「見えるところだから入れたんです。それか見えないところで全身、和彫りにしようかと思った」と“究極”の２択だったことをあっさり明かし、驚かせていた。
タトゥーを入れて何か変わったか？の問いには「絵、入れたぐらいで何も変わんない」と話していた。引用元：Yahoo!ニュース
しかし、なぜ木下百花さんは目立つところに、しかも蜘蛛というデザインのタトゥーを入れようと思ったのでしょうか？
木下百花がタトゥーを入れた理由。なぜ首に蜘蛛のデザインを選んだ？ アウトデラックスではマツコデラックスさんも矢部さんも木下の刺青にドン引きしたようなリアクションでした。
番組でお二人に刺青を入れた理由と、そのデザインを選んだ訳を聞かれて、
「見えるところだから入れたんです。それか見えないところで全身、和彫りにしようかと思った」
と説明しました。
木下さん的には、見えない部分全体に和彫りorワンポイントで洋物デザイン←この二択だったみたいです。
入れたこと自体の説明はされておらず、蜘蛛のデザインについても詳細は説明されませんでした。
そういえば、過去にゴマキの弟で元EEジャンプのメンバーだった後藤ユウキさんが、首に鯉の刺青を入れたとして話題になってました。彼は近年になって刺青を入れた理由を「舐められたくなかった」とだけ語っていました。
もしかしたら木下百花さんも単純な理由で刺青を入れただけで深い理由はないのかもしれません。
木下百花に性同一性障害やガンの噂 木下百花さんはアイドル時代からベリーショートヘアーで、グループ内でもイケメンキャラとして活躍されていました。
あるメンバーにキスするという演出が許されたり、彼女の男性的な立ち位置はメンバーやファンの間ではお馴染みでありました。
当時から男性に興味がないと噂され、在籍してた時代に男性とのスキャンダルが出るということもありませんでした。
恋愛禁止のグループを出て早４年。当時はやりたい放題の彼女は風紀的にはちゃめちゃなことをしでかすと予想されていましたが、卒業後も男性とのスキャンダルは出ていません。
昔と変わらず一貫としてベリーショート、決してスカートやフリルの付いた服は着ないボーイッシュなファッション、そしてあのヤンキーのような厳ついタトゥー。
正直、彼女にバイや性同一知性障害の噂出てしまうのは仕方ないことだと思います。
ただ、なぜガンというキーワードが出てしまうのでしょうか？
木下百花のガンの噂の理由。絶対にガセネタ 過去、週刊誌などでもそのような記事はありませんし、彼女の活動を見てる限り、とてもガンの方には無理なスケジュールで働いています。
アイドル時代に体調不良を理由に長期お休みしたことがあったのです、そこで彼女に病弱なイメージがついてしまったということでしょうか？
卒業した後は問題なく活動されているので、アイドル時代のは体よりも精神的なことが理由だったと思われます、
ガンの噂は間違いなくガセネタだと思います。
木下百花に彼女がいる噂は確かに・・・ 木下百花さんに彼女がいると思い込むのはしょうがないことです。
アイドル時代は女同士でキスをするという演出があり、とても絵になっていました。
本人からも可愛い女子が好きなような発言がありましたし、もしかしたら私生活でも女性と恋愛をしてる可能性があります。
現在までに噂になっている女性はいませんが、このまま歌手活動を順調に行なっているうちに週刊誌にすっぱ抜かれることもあるでしょう。
ただ、仮に普通に男性との交際が発覚したら、それはそれでギャップがあって可愛らしいですね。人気俳優とかであったら何だかカッコいいですね。
ちなみに海外ではハリウッドスターのクリステン・スチュワートが男の彼氏を作ったり女の彼女を作ったり堂々と両刀の恋をし、ファンもそれを認めてます。
日本ではその手の芸能人がどう扱われるのか、木下さんがクリステンのようなゴシップを繰り返す日が来る時、その反応が楽しみですね。

In our experience Civ V is a hybrid bottlenecked game – we have every reason to believe it’s bottlenecked by the CPU at certain points, but the disparity between NVIDIA and AMD’s performance indicates there’s a big difference in how the two are settings things up under the hood.</description></item><item><title>Grimes Secretly Welcomes Her Second Child with Elon Musk</title><link>/grimes-second-baby-elon-musk.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/grimes-second-baby-elon-musk.html</guid><description>X Æ A-12 is officially a big brother.

菅田将暉
小松菜奈
菅田さんと小松さんといえば、過去に多くの作品で共演し、交際の噂がされていました。
二人のファンは前々から二人が結婚することに期待していましたが、それがしっかり実現されたということで祝福よりも「ホッとした」というような声が多くありました。
素晴らしい作品で共演してる二人ですが、過去の作品について振り返ってみたいと思います。
また、馴れ初めや結婚する前の交際の報道、結婚した後の挙式や子供についても書いてみたいと思います。
菅田将暉と小松菜奈の出会いと交際期間。いつから付き合っていた？ 菅田将暉さんと小松菜奈さんが初めて共演したのは2016年の「ディストラクション・ベイビーズ」です。
撮影は2015年の5月だったので、馴れ初めは菅田将暉さんは22歳、小松菜奈さんは19歳の頃でした。
同年2016年に「溺れるナイフ」でも共演、出会った年に２作続けて共演したということです。
出会った最初から交際に発展したわけではなく、最初は親交関係を深めるだけだったそうです。
特に最初の共演した映画ではほとんど会話はしておらず、2回目の共演の「溺れるナイフ」で仲良くなったようです。
私も先に『ディストラクション・ベイビーズ』で、その後『溺れるナイフ』の撮影で良かったなと思ってます。『溺れるナイフ』では精神的にすごく頼らせていただきました。『ディストラクション・ベイビーズ』のときは現場でほとんど話をすることもなかったんです。でも、『溺れるナイフ』の時は支えてもらわないと生きていけない状態だったので（笑） それに撮影時は19歳だったので、気持ち的にもこのタイミングで『溺れるナイフ』が撮れてよかったなと思います。
菅田さんも小松さんも『ディストラクション・ベイビーズ』から『溺れるナイフ』で再共演した流れが助かったと話しています。
小松さんの方が菅田さんよりも早めに撮影に入ったそうで、かなり精神的にやられ、菅田さんが合流した際に以前の小松さんと違った雰囲気でビックリしたそうです。
ちなみに「溺れるナイフ」で菅田さんが演じた役（コウちゃん）は、小松さんにとってそのままの存在のように感じたそうです。
しかし、菅田さんは出会った当初から小松菜奈さんのことを気にしていたそうです。一方の小松菜奈さんは、菅田さんに直接と”嫌い”と言っていたそうです。
それぞれが「今だから言えること」を発表。前回の舞台あいさつで、劇中、菅田さんに本気で殴られ、逆に本気で蹴ったことを打ち明けた小松さんは、「菅田さんのことが嫌いでした」と衝撃告白。「ただただ暴力を振るわれて、（菅田が演じた）裕也ももちろん嫌いなんですけど菅田さんまで嫌いになった」とか。
引用元：シネマカフェ
セリフを覚えるのに苦労してる小松さんを見かねて、菅田さんは「セリフ一緒にやろうか？」って言ってくれたのに、小松さんは負けず嫌いを発揮し「いや、大丈夫です！」と断ったそうです。
「溺れるナイフ」は小松菜奈にとって仕事も私生活も変えた作品 映画「溺れるナイフ」の撮影ではかなり苦労したという小松菜奈さん。
後のインタビューで、
10代ギリギリの時期でこういう映画に出演できたっていう意味と、山戸監督とお仕事できたっていう意味は自分の中で大きなものだったと思いますね。
と答えており、作品と監督に出会えたことは、女優人生にとってかなり大きかったと語っています。
今となっては、将来の旦那さんになる菅田将暉さんと仲良くなれた作品ということで、私生活も変え、小松さんの人生そのものを変えた俊作だったといえます。
2019年に「niko and…」のCMで再共演、「糸」の撮影で交際スタート 以前に続けて映画で共演するも、交際に至らなかったお二人。
しかし、2019年に「niko and…」のCMで共演する頃には、見事に恋仲になりました。
菅田将暉さんと小松菜名さんが交際を始めたのは2019年の秋です。
つまり2021年の11月に結婚するまで、2年の友人関係＋3年の交際期間があったということになります。かなりバランスの良い数字です。
その頃（2019年）は2020年に公開された共演作「糸」の撮影期間（2019年7月〜9月）で、以前から小松さんに好意を寄せていた菅田さんから猛アタックがあったそうです。
菅田さんが小松菜奈さんに惚れていた理由というのは、
「長らく友人同士だった2人ですが、菅田さんは小松さんの飾らない人柄に以前から好意を寄せていたそうです。小松さんも、何事にもひたむきな菅田さんを尊敬していて本当にお似合いのカップルですよ」
と、小松さんのサバサバしてて飾らない性格が好きだったようです。
ちなみに小松菜奈さんの性格といえば、過去に関西出身のアイドル・小瀧望さんに「関西出身なら、面白いことをしてください」と無茶振りをしたり、かなりドSだと認知されています。

Moving on from our look at gaming performance, we have our customary look at compute performance. With AMD’s architectural changes from the 5000 series to the 6000 series, focusing particularly on compute performance, this can help define the 6990 compared to the 5970. However at the same time, neither benchmark here benefits from the dual-GPU design of the 6990 very much.
Our first compute benchmark comes from Civilization V, which uses DirectCompute to decompress textures on the fly.</description></item><item><title>Dom DeLuise Height</title><link>/dom-deluise-height.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/dom-deluise-height.html</guid><description>Dom DeLuise is a professional Actor&amp;nbsp;and he&amp;nbsp;is born on Brooklyn, New York,&amp;nbsp;United States.&amp;nbsp;Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Dom DeLuise Height, Weight and Body Measurements.
