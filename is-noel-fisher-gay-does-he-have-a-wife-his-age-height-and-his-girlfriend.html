Fisher credits his parents for the talented artist he has become.&nbsp;The actor has repeatedly said that his parents encouraged him to take different types of lessons, including piano, his favorite.&nbsp;He also took acting lessons and, at the age of 14, got his first role in&nbsp;</span><span>The Sheldon Kennedy Story</span><span>, a sports drama film about hockey player Sheldon Kennedy.</span></p><p><span>Noel Fisher hasn’t looked back since then, although fame for him was not instantaneous.&nbsp;Throughout her teenage years, Fisher starred in both small and big-screen roles, but neither was big enough to be called her breakthrough until the mid-2000s. Fisher’s first hit came.&nbsp;</span><span>Godiva</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Rich</span><span>.&nbsp;He celebrated his first successes by sponsoring a baby girl in Zambia, an experience he described as one of the most rewarding of his life.</span></p><p>Fisher has had roles in notable shows like&nbsp;<span>Bones, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Criminal Minds: Suspicious Behavior</span><span>, and many more.&nbsp;He got a major break after being cast as gay thug Mickey Milkovich in&nbsp;</span><span>Shameless</span><span>.&nbsp;Fisher missed the final callback for his character on Shameless.&nbsp;However, he was so desperate for the role that he recorded an impersonation director session which he sent to the casting directors.&nbsp;Fortunately, they liked it and called it to read the part.&nbsp;The rest is history.</span></p><p><span>In movies, Noel Fisher had roles in&nbsp;</span><span>War Los Angeles</span><span>&nbsp;(2011), and&nbsp;</span><span>The Twilight Saga: Breaking the Dawn – Part 2</span><span>&nbsp;(2012), where he played the 1,500-year-old vampire Vladimir.&nbsp;He voiced the character Michelangelo in two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated films.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Noel Fisher gay, has a wife or girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>When an actor plays a particular character, well, audiences are bound to wonder if he’s drawing on real personal experiences.&nbsp;Such is the case with Noel Fisher, who plays an incredible role as gay character Mickey Milkovich on Showtime’s Shameless.</span></p><p>The thing is, Noel Fisher is really just a great actor and doesn’t draw on any personal experience to portray this gay part.&nbsp;In fact, Fisher is not only straight, but differs from his character in Shameless, a faithful lover.&nbsp;Since 2005, even before he found success in the industry, Fisher has been in a relationship with famous Afghan actress Layla Alizada to whom he is now married.</p><p><span>The pair reunited in the make-up trailer for Canadian comedy-drama Godiva’s.&nbsp;However, they didn’t show much interest until the party ended.&nbsp;That night they got closer and had their first kiss.&nbsp;After about a decade of dating, Fisher popped the question to her Afghan stepfather during a romantic trip to St. Regis in Bora Bora in May 2014.</span></p><p><span>The couple waited another year before sealing the deal in an intimate wedding ceremony held on July 15, 2017, which was attended by only 60 close relatives and friends.&nbsp;In their interview with PEOPLE, the couple described their day as a magical day.&nbsp;The bride was dressed in a dress by Morilee while Fisher opted for a sky blue tuxedo by Kenneth Cole.</span></p><p><span>Layla Alizada was born on August 10, 1977. She has appeared on many notable TV shows among them&nbsp;</span><span>The Muppets, Days of Our Lives, Eyes Closed</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Jane the Virgin</span><span>.&nbsp;The couple starred together in the 2015 Oscar-nominated short&nbsp;</span><span>Day One</span><span>.&nbsp;They have long been settled in Los Angeles.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>Noel Fisher is of average height, being 170cm (5ft 7in) tall.&nbsp;Fisher is a few inches shorter than his wife Layla Alizada, who is about 6 feet tall.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiho2K7sLHLZp2iq5iav26zwLJknaeVqHqpsYyhmK%2BdXZZ6uLXFnmShoaNirqixjKGcop%2BYqXqiusNmn6KrXZy2s7jFq6CeppRk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-noel-fisher-gay-does-he-have-a-wife-his-age-height-and-his-girlfriend.html&text=Is%20Noel%20Fisher%20gay%2c%20does%20he%20have%20a%20wife%3fHis%20age%2c%20height%20and%20his%20girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-noel-fisher-gay-does-he-have-a-wife-his-age-height-and-his-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-noel-fisher-gay-does-he-have-a-wife-his-age-height-and-his-girlfriend.html&title=Is%20Noel%20Fisher%20gay%2c%20does%20he%20have%20a%20wife%3fHis%20age%2c%20height%20and%20his%20girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-noel-fisher-gay-does-he-have-a-wife-his-age-height-and-his-girlfriend.html&title=Is%20Noel%20Fisher%20gay%2c%20does%20he%20have%20a%20wife%3fHis%20age%2c%20height%20and%20his%20girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-noel-fisher-gay-does-he-have-a-wife-his-age-height-and-his-girlfriend.html&title=Is%20Noel%20Fisher%20gay%2c%20does%20he%20have%20a%20wife%3fHis%20age%2c%20height%20and%20his%20girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-noel-fisher-gay-does-he-have-a-wife-his-age-height-and-his-girlfriend.html&description=Is%20Noel%20Fisher%20gay%2c%20does%20he%20have%20a%20wife%3fHis%20age%2c%20height%20and%20his%20girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lucinda-southworth-husband-meet-larry-page.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lucinda Southworth Husband: Who is Larry Page?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heres-every-upcoming-musical-biopic-we-have-to-look-forward-to-in-2022-and-beyond.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heres every upcoming musical biopic we can look forward to in 2022 and beyond">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
