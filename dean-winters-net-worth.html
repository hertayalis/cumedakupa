According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Winters’ net worth is $4 million. He has over 40 TV series and film credits to his name that have significantly improved his wealth, and he has also appeared in series of Allstate Insurance commercials.</p><h3>Dean Winters Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Dean Winters grew up on Long Island, but moved to Scottsdale, Arizona where he spent his teenage years with three siblings: writer Bradford Winters, actor Scott William Winters, and Blair Winters. Dean went to the Jesuit Brophy College Preparatory school in Phoenix from where he matriculated in 1982. He later attended Colorado College.<br>Dean’s TV debut came in 1995 when he appeared as Tom Marans in three episodes of the crime drama “Homicide: Life on the Street” (1995-1996). His debut on the big screen occurred in 1997 in <a href=#>Richard Donner</a>’s mystery “Conspiracy Theory”, starring <a href=#>Mel Gibson</a>, <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>, and <a href=#>Patrick Stewart</a>. Winters also had a smaller part in the TV movie “Lifebreath” (1997), starring Luke Perry. However, his most notable role was as Ryan O’Reilly in “Oz” (1997-2003), one of the most popular shows at the time, and in which Winters established himself as an actor, leading to appearances in numerous series and movies.</p><p>He was cast in bigger roles in Rich Murray’s movie “Snipes” (2001), Rich Devaney’s crime-drama “Brooklyn Bound” (2004), and Brandon Davies’ “Bristol Boys” (2006).

During the early 2000s, his net worth rose immensely thanks to the popularity of these TV series and films, in which he appeared.</p><p>Winters returned to film and roles in several movies including “P.S. I Love You” (2007), starring <a href=#>Gerard Butler</a> and <a href=#>Hilary Swank</a>, Brant Sersen’s “Splinterheads” (2009), and he starred in David Kaplan’s comedy “Today’s Special” (2009). He also appeared in nine episodes of “Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles” (2008-2009), and “Life on Mars” (2008-2009). Most recently, Winters had roles in TV shows “Battle Creek” (2015), “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” (2013-2015), and comedy “Divorce” (2016-), starring <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> – with whom he had played in one episode of “Sex and the City” in 1999 – increasing further his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Dean Winters is of the Irish and Scottish descent and is fluent in Italian. He had the near-death experience in 2009 when he died in the back of the ambulance due to a cardiac arrest, but the emergency response team brought him back to life 3.5 minutes after.
