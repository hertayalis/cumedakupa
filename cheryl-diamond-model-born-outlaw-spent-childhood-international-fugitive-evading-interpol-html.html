'It's the simple mistakes that get you caught,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now aged 34 and living in Rome, the former outlaw details her unimaginable life in her gripping new memoir,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Nowhere Girl: A Memoir of a Fugitive Childhood</a>. With <a href=# style=font-weight:700 rel=nofollow>Interpol</a> reports and sworn affidavits to back it up, Cheryl Diamond proves that truth is stranger than fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Belying her serene blue eyes and cascading blonde hair is a life of global intrigue - and a childhood that was more akin to the pages of James Bond than Dr. Seuss.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She claims her first memory was a near death experience at the age of four when brake failure sent her family's rickety car hurtling down the Himalayas. They survived, only to narrowly escape a tense face-off with two Kashmiri soldiers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To her, life was one thrilling adventure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time she was nine, Diamond and her seemingly unbreakable family of five had already lived in more than a dozen countries, across five continents, under six aliases. One day they were in Cairo, the next in Vienna.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The drill was always the same: move without warning, destroy all evidence, and change names with new invented backstories. Repeat. They slipped by on forged documents, crisscrossing the globe while always remaining a few steps ahead of Interpol.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the meantime, Diamond managed to train as a near-level Olympic gymnast, work as a teenage fashion model in New York City and publish her first book at the age of 19 - all under different aliases.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But as she got older, the mystery of her past and that of her parents began to unravel: Who were they? And what were they running from? Diamond didn't know their real names and birthdates – or her own for that matter.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With her identity burned many times over, Cheryl Diamond (a pen name) realized that she belonged nowhere in the world. There was no real proof that she existed.&nbsp;After winging an entire life on fake passports, it seemed that getting a real one would prove to be the greatest challenge of all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img id=i-c6ac86e8a8983bd1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/28/14/44371169-9674507-image-a-173_1624886300515.jpg height=619 width=962 alt="Cheryl Diamond was the daughter of a controlling, professional conman who led his family of five on a transcontinental escape for three decades.

'I could not imagine that my future had already been written in the stamp of a fake passport before I was even conceived.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the youngest of three siblings with a ten-year age gap, Cheryl was the center of her family's universe. And despite the unusual circumstances, she remembers the halcyon days of her childhood on the run as joyful and exciting.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So 'why did we run so fast and for so long? Why did we risk it all?' she writes in real-time. 'That answer is simple. We were being hunted.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Beginning at a very young age, Cheryl noticed that her father, George, checked into hotels under different last names. 'Most often Cash, Sterling, and Gold, my father seemed to like money-related names.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was never clear where their money came from, she said, 'I'm taught to shoplift, but that's just to build character.' Nonetheless, money was 'always there, just a wire transfer away. Ready to buy us freedom.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When they moved, it was always sudden and generally involved frantic packing, leaving possessions in storage facilities (or not) and dashing to the airport to go wherever Cheryl's father decided - by looking at the upcoming flights leaving that day.<span class=mol-style-italic>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Life on the road meant that most lessons were taught on the fly, said Diamond. 'Since Dad considers all educational institutions breeding grounds for government propaganda and square-thinking bureaucrats.' Lessons in core subjects like math, and writing were few and far in between, taught by her mother mostly on the swirling carpet of five star hotels while on the run.&nbsp;<span style=font-size:18px></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:18px>But her hardest lesson was something very different, she said. '</span>I had to learn our rules:' 1) Always have a back story. 'With each new country, Dad not only changes our last name, but also builds a different history, a different place we're from,' she wrote. 'He drills me in mock interrogations when I least expect it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>2) Never give outsiders your home phone number. Instead, set up an answering service in a different town where people can leave a message after the beep. 3) Forward all mail to a P.O. Box and take abrupt turns, circuitous routes before picking it up. 4) Pay for everything in cash.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nothing was as important as their cardinal rule: 'When you leave a place—no matter how much you love it, no matter how many friends you've made—you can never, ever go back,' she writes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So deeply ingrained were these guidelines that Diamond never dared to question them at first. Nor did she question why her family fled countries, seemingly at the drop of a hat (and often in the middle of the night).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img id=i-348beb9b8bf83022 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/28/14/44371935-9674507-image-a-175_1624886300517.jpg height=1017 width=962 alt="'Back then it all seemed so right,' she said.

Her two siblings were in fact, half siblings. Her mother, Anne, whom she always thought was French, was really Italian and raised in Luxembourg.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And the person hunting them? She claims was actually Cheryl's grandfather - a high-powered operative in the Luxembourg secret police who disagreed with Anne's unconventional lifestyle and threatened to use his influence to declare her an unfit mother and take her children away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>George was a handsome and charming gold bullion trader from Canada who offered Anne a way out. And so the stage was set for the great international drama that would take this family of five across several continents and forever alter the course of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>True, they weren't criminals yet, but they eventually would be. 'Sometimes when someone starts treating you like a criminal, you have to become one to escape,' said Diamond.</p><img id=i-41c6b068e7f50413 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/13/19/44371183-9674507-Chery_Diamond_s_absorbing_memoir_chronicles_her_traumatic_childh-a-11_1626199532874.jpg height=710 width=470 alt="Chery Diamond's absorbing memoir chronicles her traumatic childhood spent on the run.

Her identity was erased so many times that she ultimately did not legally exist anywhere. As she began to see her controlling father's deception more clearly, she questioned 'was it all necessary?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With the walls closing in, they needed money and they needed it fast. Faced with little choice, George drained an account containing almost $2million of investor's money in his gold bullion fund. 'In that moment he became the criminal Anne's father had framed him as,' wrote Diamond.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Years later, Cheryl wondered if it was all necessary. After her family bought new passports, they were successfully off the grid; and yet they continued to flee. 'My father must have known we didn’t have to run anymore.' Questioning his motives, she believes that their decades-long escape&nbsp;was really the deluded plot of a megalomaniac to isolate and control his family.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Maybe he was using the past to control us, or perhaps we had all lived in fear so long that none of us knew how to stop.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time Cheryl was born, her family had already spent a few years on the road as nomadic Sikhs. Her real name, 'Harbhajan Khalsa Nanak,' translates to Song of God/ Pure/ Truth in Sanskrit. 'It's not just a name, it's everything I know we stand for,' she writes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As practicing Sikhs, they abided by the sacred tradition of keeping long uncut hair, maintained a strict vegetarian diet and automatically recited prayers in Punjabi before every meal. As a family, they performed weekly half-hour silent meditations, and daily Kundalini yoga sessions.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We must make quite a confusing picture,' she wrote. 'Just an average family of Sikhs. Except the father is a broad-shouldered six-foot Viking, face deeply tanned, with a head of untamed red-blond hair.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But like many things in their life, Sikhism would fly out the window with a new identity, backstory and country.&nbsp;George would eventually convert his family to Judaism, and Cheryl will celebrate a Bat Mitzvah while attending an Orthodox school in Virginia. It was a decision that he seemingly made on a whim, she says, after he stumbled 'across the idea that Jewish people dominate the world financial markets.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We have switched faiths like so many names, and now I have trouble taking anything seriously,' she says in her memoir, which unravels in real time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cheryl's first brush with a 'normal' life happened at the age of seven when her family accidentally stayed in Vancouver for two years. (They had never lived anywhere longer than eight months before). Her family moved into a grand secluded two-story mansion which they furnished with plastic outdoor patio furniture, that 'seemed like a good temporary option when we moved in.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She recalls the awkward practice of meeting kids her age for the first time, 'Why is it that the more ordinary a situation is, the more it paralyzes me with anxiety?'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But for a brief moment, Cheryl got to experience a standard childhood: she was involved in competitive swimming and gymnastics, she enrolled in a puppet theatre group, joined an abacus club and took a children's art class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She didn't take any of it for granted. 'For the rest, there will always be next summer, next year,' she said. 'For us, everything we are tasting maybe for the last time.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few weeks later, clothes, books, and toys were scattered on the floor as her family frantically packed their suitcases. George's Vancouver business partner in a get-rich-quick scheme started asking too many questions, and spooked the family when he showed up at their front door demanding answers earlier that evening.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 4am, Diamond said, 'it looked like a tornado had torn through our house.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The drill was always the same: destroy all evidence of life, wipe finger prints and change names. They burned all important documents, and threw away other distinguishing items in random garbage bins on the way to the airport.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Within three hours, they were boarded on a flight to Germany with 14 suitcases in tow, leaving most of their belongings behind.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The concept of travelling light fascinates me,' said Diamond. 'It takes me until the age of five to figure out that other people didn't take all their worldly possessions with them to airports.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-9175ee49af812725 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/07/13/19/44371999-9674507-Diamond_got_her_first_taste_of_normal_life_when_she_was_seven_ye-a-10_1626199532461.jpg height=740 width=962 alt="Diamond got her first taste of 'normal' life when she was seven-years-old and her family moved to Vancouver for two years.

Without any documentation of prior education (or any record of existence for that matter), they trade on the fact that she lived in Israel to get in.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We have all emerged from a fog a couple years ago, fully formed, yet lacking any history.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For a short while, Cheryl's life had all the hallmark trappings of a typical teenager: boys, jealous friends, school dances, and insecurities. But despite her best attempts to fit in, she said, 'This gap, between my life and theirs, seems too wide to bridge. An impossible chasm filled with terrible secrets—all the things that make me strange, different.' That feeling will follow Cheryl well into adulthood.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I suppose what it all boils down to, is this, I know how to survive, and they know how to live.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And just when things started to seem all-too-easy, she says, 'I'm reminded how far away I am from normal.'

New York City offered the promise of hope, 'a way to pull us out.' And without pause, Cheryl (still going by Crystal at the time) bought herself a fake&nbsp;North Carolina state ID card and hopped on the next bus to the Big Apple to start her new life as 'Cheryl Diamond.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For the next five years, she survived hand-to-mouth hustling between runways and photoshoots, posing for brands like L'Oréal, Clairol and Armani.

Done with running, done with living off the grid and done following her father – whom she now believes has a 'severe undiagnosed mental illness of some kind.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Flimsy $30 fake IDs were no longer tenable and Cheryl was desperate for legitimacy. The problem is, she technically doesn't belong to any country.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While her New Zealand birth certificate is a legally issued document, her parents are listed under false identities and forged Brazilian nationalities. The dilemma poses a legal nightmare. There is no haven&nbsp;for children in the home countries that their parents abandoned. If Cheryl were to claim citizenship in any country, she would be held accountable for continuing the fraud her parents started.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After many years if legal maneuvering, she was finally granted Luxembourgish citizenship at the age of 27.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was only then, that she began to see the wool of her father's deception more clearly. 'All the places, all the things we would end up leaving behind. Why was it all necessary?' she pondered. 'He'd said it was because my grandfather and Interpol were chasing us. But was it because he'd stolen all that money, or was it . . . because it's easier to make a family do what you want when they are terrified?'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now living in Rome, the 'nowhere girl' has finally found a place where she belongs. After a life perpetual motion, she finds stability and comfort in the ancient city's history.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her memoir is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and a decade-long labor of love that she said, 'started as a way to rectify the feeling of not belonging to the world.' The prologue reads, 'This is for the misfits.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I used to think that I would never be truly accepted by other people if they knew about my history,' she told DailyMail.com. 'I always thought that people would see me as a freak because what I lived was so outside the bounds of normality - and also very traumatic and abusive at times.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That was also a big reason why I wrote Nowhere Girl,' she says. The more she opened up about her past, the more Cheryl realized how many people could relate with their own struggles. 'Of course they didn't have a story as crazy as mine – that's one in a million!'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The thing I really like about being an adult is that you can choose your family.' The only person Cheryl maintains a relationship with is her mother. She hasn't spoken to Chiara in 10 years, and has no contact with her father. 'I think blood is only important if those people act like your family and care about you in that way,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When asked if she could go back and change the family that she was born into, would she do it?
