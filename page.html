I don’t know about you but I’m the laziest holiday shopper ever. In fact, Black Friday crowds at the mall might be one of my biggest phobias (followed by cruise boats and pulp, in case you were curious). If you’re anything like me, you’re going to love using Keep. Here’s how it works –&nbsp;you set up a profile and curate Collections. I’ve filled mine with tons of my favorite food and kitchen finds (the items pictured here &&nbsp;more). You can follow me and I’ll follow you, and together&nbsp;we’ll inspire each other…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I can hardly believe it’s November already. Of course that’s because generally&nbsp;it’s warm and sunny&nbsp;here in Austin.&nbsp;Just last week&nbsp;I was trying to explain to my mom (in Chicago) how 80 degrees can indeed feel like fall to us. While we might not have extreme season changes,&nbsp;winter produce is slowly starting to show up. Pears, Pomegranates… I’ll take them all. Today, I’m sharing a few more of my favorite easy&nbsp;ideas for pairing fresh produce with McCormick’s Gourmet Spices. Mushrooms:&nbsp;To me, nothing is more comforting (yet healthy) in the wintertime than mushrooms. We just love&nbsp;cremini mushrooms in&nbsp;hearty soups. I make a version…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I love to think of this pear crisp recipe as a “pair crisp.” With quotation marks. Because this is a dessert for 2. Get it? Jack is sitting next to me right now shaking his head, but honestly, I love desserts that are easy to make in small portions. See, if I made a pear crisp recipe large enough to serve 4, it would still serve just the two of us. Just one more bite after one more bite, and it would all be over. We have no control, especially around sweet, cinnamon-spiced fall desserts like this one. (And pssst!…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>You may or may not have noticed, but I love salads. I intended to start November off with big hearty Thanksgiving inspiration… but, well, I’m not sure if&nbsp;the thought of mashed potatoes made my jeans&nbsp;feel tighter&nbsp;or if it was all the Christmas cookies I ate last week (don’t ask)… this week I ended up craving soups and, especially, salads. I’m really excited about this salad because it’s so simple&nbsp;yet so delicious&nbsp;with all of its&nbsp;shred-y,&nbsp;crunchy textures. If you have a mandoline, this will go really quickly. If you don’t, you can&nbsp;use a sharp knife,&nbsp;just&nbsp;try to slice everything as thinly as you…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Are you sugared out yet? Since I already posted my one and only candy idea, I wasn’t quite sure what to make for today.&nbsp;I was going to skip this holiday post altogether until Jack came up with the genius thematic idea to make something with black forbidden rice.&nbsp;I had a pumpkin sitting on my countertop as well as some blood oranges… so naturally, I came up with the&nbsp;ultimate Halloween&nbsp;salad for this L&L Spook-tacular post. (That’s what Jack is calling it). I made a&nbsp;blood orange vinaigrette spiced with cumin, coriander, and a bit of cinnamon. I just love how the warm…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The first time I had spaghetti squash, it was served with a big scoop of store-bought marinara sauce mixed in. It was slimy and goop-y and decidedly not spaghetti-like. About a month ago, ditching the pasta idea completely,&nbsp;I planned a post&nbsp;for&nbsp;bbq spaghetti squash tacos. I have a super cute photo to prove that the meal existed,&nbsp;but the recipe&nbsp;ended in&nbsp;total disaster. So, long story short, I’ve learned that I prefer my&nbsp;spaghetti squash as simple as possible and most importantly: sauce-less. The roasted strands come out of the oven with&nbsp;a nice al-dente bite, but, smothered in sauce, they become just too mushy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Here’s my question for all of you pumpkin lovers out there – what do you do with your leftover pumpkin puree? So many recipes (including my own)&nbsp;call for 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree.&nbsp;Whether I open a can or roast a whole pumpkin, I’m always left with leftover mash. It&nbsp;calls at me from the fridge saying “how about pumpkin cookies?” or “let’s make muffins.” But after consuming too many pancakes for the making of last week’s&nbsp;post, I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;in the mood for anything sweet. So I got this idea for pumpkin hummus… and I thought it would be great smushed in between tortillas&nbsp;with…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>To say that these are the best gluten-free pancakes I’ve ever had would be selling this stack short. I hesitate to ever make claims that something is “the best,” because taste is so subjective after all. But these (in my opinion) have to be right up there with the best pancakes I’ve ever eaten, gluten-free or not. I made these the other day for Jack and my mom (who is in town visiting right now). After we tasted, my mom said “what’s that special flour you used? I’ll have to get some of that.” “That flour” I used is Pamela’s…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I make a lot of impromptu tacos. We not only have taco Tuesdays around here, but sometimes taco Wednesdays and/or&nbsp;taco Thursdays. When I’m looking for something quick I usually reach for tortillas,&nbsp;no matter what day of the week it might be. I keep them in the freezer, so they’re always ready. Except this particular night – no tortillas, but I had some sprouted pitas. This wasn’t originally going to be a post, but these turned out so pretty and delicious. And who&nbsp;doesn’t need a quick dinner idea? I roasted chopped sweet potatoes and zucchini and tossed them with dried harissa…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Butternut squash soup may be my favorite fall comfort food, but this butternut squash pasta is now a close second. It’s a pretty easy throw-together pasta&nbsp;made from a classic fall flavor combo:&nbsp;butternut squash, sage, and walnuts. The sweet, caramelized squash plays perfectly off the earthy sage and nutty walnuts, and a little butter and pecorino add the perfect amount of richness. This is one we’ll have on repeat all season long. To make it, simply roast the squash until it’s tender and caramelized. Then, sauté the shallot, sage, walnuts, chickpeas, cooked butternut squash, and garlic until the chickpeas and squash…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Once or twice a week, I get a huge bounty of fresh produce. My Farmhouse box arrives every other Wednesday, and&nbsp;I shop my local farmers market on Saturdays. Over the years I’ve learned a few strategies for cleaning, storing and using fruits and&nbsp;vegetables to make sure everything lasts throughout the week. I absolutely hate throwing food away. I know you do too, so I’m hoping you find&nbsp;this little guide helpful to avoid food-waste for yourself.
