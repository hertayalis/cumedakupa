He is the son of <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>. Jeff is an American entrepreneur known for being the founder and Executive Chairman of Amazon, Inc. He is one of the richest men in the world having an estimated net worth of <strong>$127 Billion</strong>.</p><p>Preston is the oldest son of Jeff and he also has two brothers and an adopted sister. His mother is Mackenzie Scott. He stands at the height of 5 Feet and 9 Inches (<strong>175 cm</strong>) and has a body weight of 143 lbs (65 kg).</p><h2>Net Worth Of Preston's Father, Jeff Bezos&nbsp;</h2><p>Preston Bezos is still a student at the time of this writing so, instead, we will shift our focus to the wealth of his father. Jeff Bezos is one of the richest humans in the world and has an estimated net worth of <strong>$127 Billion</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/7/unknown_301484059_124309753681087_2811665648416753507_n%20(1)-1680864177366.jpg><p>Jeff's biggest source of income is his company, Amazon. It is an electronic commerce company. However, he has also extended his company to a lot of different fields like streaming services, film productions, and video games among others.</p><p>Preston's father would probably have much bigger wealth if wasn't for the divorce from his mother, Mackenzie Scott. The divorce settlement is globally known for being the most expensive divorce settlement of all time. Jeff had to pay <strong>$38.3 Billion</strong> to settle his divorce.</p><h2>Relationship Status: Does Preston Have A Girlfriend?</h2><p>Preston Bezos at the moment does not have any partner and is living a single life. He is still in his 20s so getting involved in a relationship is the least of his worry.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, most of Preston's time is invested in his education and making a career. The other time, he is making the most out of his single life and is enjoying time with his friend and family.</p><p>Jeff's oldest son, Preston lives a quiet life and hasn't revealed much about his love life. Hence, there are no records of his previous relationships. He is also absent from social media which makes it hard to keep track of his life.</p><h2>Preston's Parents Are No Longer Together</h2><p>Preston's parents sadly no longer live under the same roof as they have divorced. Jeff Bezos and Mackenzie Scott. The two officially filed for divorce on <strong>July 5, 2019</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>Jeff&nbsp;and &nbsp;Mackenzie&nbsp;were married for more than two decades. They first walked down the aisle on<strong> September 4, 1993</strong>, just a day after <a href=#>Darby Hinton</a> married Shan Hinton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/7/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20163221%20(1)-1680864472302.jpg><p>Jeff is to blame for the crumbling of his marriage to Mackenzie as he cheated on her wife with his current girlfriend, <a href=#>Lauren Sanchez</a>. Lauren is a journalist by profession and has previously won the prestigious Emmy Award for her work.</p><p>Preston's mother, Mackenzie left his father and she once exchanged wedding vows with a man named, Dan Jewett. He was a teacher by profession and teaches Science at a school in Seattle. They were only married for a year as it lasted from March 2021 to September 2022.</p><h2>Preston Isn't The Only Child Of Bezos</h2><p>Preston is the oldest but he isn't the only child Jeff had with his ex-wife, Mackenzie. He has three siblings, two brothers, and one sister. Jeff is a popular figure automatically making his kids a celebrity. But, he wants to give all of his kids a normal childhood.</p><p>Hence, Preston's siblings remain a mystery to this day. Their names remain to be known and have hardly made any appearance with their father.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one thing that is known about Jeff kid's is that only his sons are his biological child but the same thing can't be said about their daughter as she was adopted.</p><h2>Studies In The Same Institute As His Father</h2><p>Preston is a student at the time of this writing and he is currently studying in the same Institute as his father, Jeff. He is studying at Princeton University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/7/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20163602%20(1)-1680864703335.jpg><p>The Washington Post owner Jeff studied at the University from 1982 to 1986. He holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. Preston however, who is known for living a low-profile life has not disclosed what subjects he is studying at Princeton.</p><h2>Preston's Sister Was Adopted</h2><p>Preston Bezos has a sister however, they don't share the same blood. It's because she was adopted. Her name remains to be known but it is no secret that she is the youngest one in the Bezos family.</p><p>The unidentified sister of Preston was adopted from China as mentioned in the <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Mirror</i></a>. Aside from that, Amazon's founder, like his biological sons has not revealed any details about her.&nbsp;</p><h2>About Preston's Biological Paternal Grandfather</h2><p>Preston Bezo's father, Jeff is the son of <strong>Miguel Bezos</strong>, however, Miguel isn't his biological father. His actual father's name is <strong>Ted Jorgensen</strong>. He was ditched by his father when he was only three and Miguel stepped up and took the responsibility.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/4/7/Screenshot%202023-04-07%20164042%20(1)-1680864970145.jpg><p>Jeff's mother, Jacklyn Gise was only 17 years old when she was pregnant with him. His father and mother were high school sweethearts and they did end up getting hitched however, their marriage didn't even last two years.</p><p>Preston's grandpa, Miguel was an immigrant from Cuba and Jeff has revealed that his father couldn't even talk English when he came to the land of opportunity. He became the father Jeff needed and his famous surname Bezos came from his stepfather.</p><h2>How Was Preston Bezos Raised?</h2><p>Jeff Bezos didn't raise his oldest son, Preston Bezos as a normal family would. Amazon's founder wants his children to be independent and learn some key things which would help them in their life. One such thing was helping them to develop easy methods to get over difficulties.</p><p>But, the technique Preston's father taught him and his siblings would be considered scary by some. He was given a knife and other power tools when he was small as reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>CNBC</i></a>. Jeff defended his decision saying that the risks that come with it would help them to be independent.</p><p>Jeff himself learned this technique from his grandfather. As a child, he used to aid his grandpa on his farm to fix all the tools and machines he had. And, he wants his kids, including Preston to do the same.</p><h2>A Brief On Preston's Father, Jeff Bezos</h2><p>Preston's father, Jeff Bezos is famously known for being one of the richest men in the world. The entrepreneur is the founder of Amazon, Inc., the biggest e-commerce company in the world.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Jeff's success came from Amazon but he has tried his hands on a lot of things. While a teenager, he started an institute called, Dream Institue. He wasn't just starting companies and has also worked in a bank at the early stages of his life with the New York Investment Bank.</p><p>Jeff's success didn't just happen overnight and is a result of hard work and determination. Amazon is a giant company today but, it started by only selling books. Before eventually moving to CDs, videos, and what it has become today.</p><p><i>Like Preston Bezos's bio?
