He has been nominated for two Grammy Awards, and has released two acclaimed albums, The Lost Boy and From a Bird’s Eye View. But how tall is Cordae? And does his height matter in his rap career? In this article, we will explore Cordae’s height, his background, and his musical achievements.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cordae’s Height: 5 Feet 9 Inches</h2><p>According to various sources, Cordae’s height is 5 feet 9 inches, or 175 cm. This makes him slightly taller than the average American male, who stands at 5 feet 8 inches, or 173 cm. However, Cordae’s height is not a major factor in his rap success. He has proven that he can hold his own against taller rappers, such as Lil Baby, Future, and Young Thug, who are all 6 feet or above.</p><p>Cordae does not seem to be insecure about his height, nor does he brag about it. He rarely mentions his height in his songs, except for a few lines, such as:</p><p>I’m 5’9″, but I’m 6’6″ when I stand on my bars</p><p>And:</p><p>I’m 5’9″, but I’m big dog, I got big dreams</p><p>These lines show that Cordae is confident and ambitious, and that he measures his worth by his rap skills, not by his physical stature.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cordae’s Background: From North Carolina to Maryland</h2><p>Cordae was born on August 26, 1997, in Raleigh, North Carolina, as Cordae Amari Dunston. He moved to Suitland, Maryland, with his family when he was eight years old, and grew up there. He has one older brother, Simba, who is also a rapper.</p><p>Cordae developed an interest in music at a young age, influenced by his father, who played classic hip hop artists such as Rakim, Nas, Big L, and Talib Kweli. He started writing raps when he was 15, and released three mixtapes under the name Entendre: Anxiety (2014), I’m So Anxious (2016), and I’m So Anonymous (2017).</p><p>He graduated from high school in 2015, and enrolled at Towson University, where he studied mass communication. However, he dropped out in 2018, to pursue his rap career full-time. He moved to Los Angeles, and joined the hip hop collective YBN, changing his stage name to YBN Cordae.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cordae’s Musical Journey: From YBN to Solo Star</h2><p>Cordae gained attention in 2018, when he released remixes of popular songs, such as “My Name Is” by Eminem, and “Old N*ggas” by J. Cole. He also released his debut single, “Kung Fu”, which became a viral hit. He was featured on the YBN collective’s mixtape, YBN: The Mixtape, along with YBN Nahmir and YBN Almighty Jay.</p><p>In 2019, Cordae released his debut solo album, The Lost Boy, which received critical acclaim and commercial success. The album peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200, and featured guest appearances from Chance the Rapper, Anderson .Paak, Ty Dolla Sign, Pusha T, and Meek Mill. The album also earned him two Grammy nominations: Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for “Bad Idea” featuring Chance the Rapper.</p><p>In 2020, Cordae dropped the “YBN” from his stage name, after the collective disbanded. He also released several singles, such as “Gifted” with Roddy Ricch, “The Parables”, and “Dream in Color”. He also participated in several social justice movements, such as Black Lives Matter and Breonna Taylor protests.</p><p>In 2022, Cordae released his second solo album, From a Bird’s Eye View, which also received positive reviews and charted at number 13 on the Billboard 200. The album featured collaborations with Eminem, Stevie Wonder, Lil Wayne, Q-Tip, and Freddie Gibbs. The album also spawned the hit single, “Super”, which peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Cordae is currently working on his third solo album, which is expected to drop in 2023. He has also hinted at more collaborations with other artists, such as Drake, J. Cole, and Kendrick Lamar. Cordae is on his way to becoming one of the best rap artists of his generation, and his height is not a hindrance in his musical journey. He is proof that talent, hard work, and passion can overcome any obstacle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmLyzsMCeZKGdmZy1tXnHqK5mrJGhuW610maroZ1dnL%2BiucyyZKennZ67osDEnWSrmaClsrN7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcordae-height-how-tall-is-the-grammy-nominated-rapper.html&text=Cordae%20Height%3a%20How%20Tall%20Is%20the%20Grammy-Nominated%20Rapper%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcordae-height-how-tall-is-the-grammy-nominated-rapper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcordae-height-how-tall-is-the-grammy-nominated-rapper.html&title=Cordae%20Height%3a%20How%20Tall%20Is%20the%20Grammy-Nominated%20Rapper%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcordae-height-how-tall-is-the-grammy-nominated-rapper.html&title=Cordae%20Height%3a%20How%20Tall%20Is%20the%20Grammy-Nominated%20Rapper%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcordae-height-how-tall-is-the-grammy-nominated-rapper.html&title=Cordae%20Height%3a%20How%20Tall%20Is%20the%20Grammy-Nominated%20Rapper%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcordae-height-how-tall-is-the-grammy-nominated-rapper.html&description=Cordae%20Height%3a%20How%20Tall%20Is%20the%20Grammy-Nominated%20Rapper%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./adam-sandler-siblings-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything We Know about Adam Sandlers Siblings: Sisters &amp;amp; Brother">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./292036-taylor-kitschs-dating-life-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Kitschs Dating Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
